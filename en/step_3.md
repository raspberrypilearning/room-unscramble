Look at the tile image filenames and work out how the names tell you where each tile should go.

<h2 class="c-project-heading--explainer">A secret code in every filename ðŸ§©</h2>

Each tile image has a filename like:

```html
bert_sampson_tile_0_1.png
```

Letâ€™s break that down:

- `bert_sampson` is the name of the image set
- `tile` means itâ€™s part of the grid
- The numbers `_0_1` show the **row** and **column** where the tile should go!

So `tile_0_1` belongs in **row 0**, **column 1** â€” thatâ€™s the **second tile on the top row**.

Hereâ€™s an example set of tiles:

<div class="c-project-code">
--- code ---
---
language: html
filename: index.html
line_numbers: true
line_number_start: 7
line_highlights: 7-10
---
<div class="tile"><img src="bert_sampson_tile_0_0.png" alt="Tile 0,0"></div>
<div class="tile"><img src="bert_sampson_tile_0_1.png" alt="Tile 0,1"></div>
<div class="tile"><img src="bert_sampson_tile_0_2.png" alt="Tile 0,2"></div>
<div class="tile"><img src="bert_sampson_tile_0_3.png" alt="Tile 0,3"></div>
--- /code ---
</div>

These are all the tiles in the **top row**, going left to right.

### Tip

The grid has **3 rows** and **4 columns** â€” the tile names help you place them in the correct order!

</div>

<div class="c-project-callout c-project-callout--debug">

### Debugging

If your layout looks wrong later, check that each tile is in the correct spot based on the numbers in its filename.
