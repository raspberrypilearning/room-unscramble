Your layout is now working â€” great job! Now it is time to give your webpage a creative twist.

Open the `style.css` file (the file icon is on the left) <img src="images/file-icon.png" alt="File icon used to open the Project files tab" width="32"/>. 

Close the gap between the tiles.

<div class="c-project-code">

language: css
filename: style.css
line_numbers: true
line_number_start: 4
line_highlights: 7

.grid {
    display: grid;
    grid-template-columns: repeat(4, 1fr);
    gap: 2px;
    max-width: 400px;
    margin: 0;
}

Have fun making the page your own!

You could also change the heading:

- Add a fun colour to the heading
- Change the font style

Hereâ€™s an example:

<div class="c-project-code">
--- code ---
---
language: css
filename: style.css
line_numbers: true
line_number_start: 1
line_highlights: 2-5
---
h1 {
    color: teal;
    font-family: "Comic Sans MS", cursive, sans-serif;
    text-shadow: 2px 2px #ffcc00;
    text-align: center;
}
--- /code ---

### Tip

You can style any part of the page using CSS â€” try changing the tile borders!

</div>

<div class="c-project-callout c-project-callout--try">

### Try this

Try giving your tiles a rainbow look! You can change the border colour of different tiles like this:

    .tile:nth-child(1) img {
        border-color: red;
    }

    .tile:nth-child(2) img {
        border-color: orange;
    }

    .tile:nth-child(3) img {
        border-color: yellow;
    }

Keep going with more colours to make a rainbow grid!

</div>
